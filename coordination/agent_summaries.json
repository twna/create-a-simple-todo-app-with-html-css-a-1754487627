We'll link these files to the HTML to ensure that the styling and functionality are applied to the app.\n\nHere's how you can integrate the CSS and JavaScript with the HTML:\n\n1. Link the CSS file within the `<head>` section of the HTML file using the `<link>` tag.\n2. Link the JavaScript file just before the closing `</body>` tag using the `<script>` tag.\n\nBelow is the JSON response with the implementation code that demonstrates how to link the CSS and JavaScript files to the HTML file:\n\n\nPlease replace `\"styles.css\"` and `\"script.js\"` with the actual paths to your CSS and JavaScript files if they are different. This code assumes that the CSS and JavaScript files are in the same directory as the HTML file. If they are in different directories, you'll need to adjust the paths accordingly."
